# Let's practice using pivot_longer to reshape our data! -----------------------------------
# 1) FIRST, CREATE A NEW DATAFRAME WHERE THE COST DATA IS PIVOTED LONGER. SAVE IT AS tuition_cost_long.
# 2) TAKE THAT NEW DATAFRAME, AND GROUP BY THE NEWLY CREATED COLUMN, cost_type. FIND THE MEDIAN cost ACROSS THE ENTIRE DATASET BY cost_type.
#    HOW MUCH MORE IS THE MEDIAN in_state_tuition THAN THE MEDIAN out_of_state_tuition? WRITE A QUICK SENTENCE BELOW #2 GIVING YOUR RESULTS.
# 3) WHY IS THE COST FOR THE room_and_board COST TYPE NA? USE FILTER APPROPRIATELY TO GET A NON-NA VALUE FOR room_and_board.
```

# 1)

```{r}
tuition_cost_long <- tuition_cost %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(___, ___, ___, ___, ___), # WHICH COLUMNS GO HERE?
               names_to = "cost_type", 
               values_to = "cost")
```

# 2)

```{r}
tuition_cost_long %>% 
  group_by(___) %>% 
  summarize(___)
```

(Write sentence here.)

# 3)

```{r}
tuition_cost_long %>% 
  filter(___) %>% 
  group_by(cost_type) %>% 
  summarize(median_cost = median(cost))
```
