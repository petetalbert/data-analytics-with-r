## IMDB Ratings across time

*The Office* saw higher average IMDB ratings of its episodes the first seven seasons, but in seasons eight and nine it dipped.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

office_ratings <- read_csv("data/office_ratings.csv")

office_ratings %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(avg_imdb_rating = mean(imdb_rating)) %>% 
  mutate(season = as_factor(season)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = avg_imdb_rating)) +
  geom_col()
```

However, in season nine, the finale was one of the highest rated episodes of the entire series.

```{r}
office_ratings %>% 
  filter(season == 9) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = episode, y = imdb_rating, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 10))
```
